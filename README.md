# I2C-Protocol
<br>
The Inter-Integrated Circuit (I²C) protocol is a synchronous two-wire serial communication standard widely used in embedded and FPGA systems. It combines the simplicity of UART with the multi-device capability of SPI, allowing multiple masters and slaves to communicate on the same bus using minimal wiring.
